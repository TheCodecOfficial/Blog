            <title>Designing Beautiful Worlds with Procedural Texture Generation</title>

            <description>In this project I tried to procedurally generate visually appealing 3D
                renders of planets and stars. By layering a bunch of noise functions we can create
                complex textures that resemble space.</description>

            <title>Reverse Engineering Blender's AgX Tonemapper</title>

            <description>Blender 4 introduced AgX as the default tone mapper, offering better handling of
                high-intensity colors. While integrating it into my own projects, I struggled with its
                LUT-based implementation and chose to create my own approximation, focusing on visual appeal
                over accuracy.</description>
